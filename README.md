Home work task =>

Create a new react app (vite link above)
Create a component
Include that component in App.jsx
Pass a prop into the component at #2
Add some state to the App component
Optional, update the state created at #5

I have created a two components Button and IsHappy.
I have imported them into App.jsx
I have passed props
I have created one set of state (isHappy)

The button (Toggle) appears in the Dom - but it does not toggle Happy or Sad.
